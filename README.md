# de-challenge-four
This is a solution for the data engineering challenge number four.

## Instructions to run the file.
The main `.py` file is called `bohora_maya_challenge4.py` which is located in `src` folder in this repository. Sample input dataset for
the program is located in `input` folder. Only a sample dataset is included in this folder due to large volume of the orginal dataset. If we have enough computing power, larger dataset can be placed in the `input` folder to be processed. Output from the `bohora_maya_challenge4.py` will be saved to the `output` folder when the program is run.
