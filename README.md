# de-challenge-four
This is a solution for the data engineering challenge number four.

## Instructions to run the file.
The main `.py` file is called `bohora_maya_challenge4.py` which is located at `src` folder in this repository. Sample input data set for
the program is located at `input` folder. Only a sample data set is included due to large volume of the orginal dataset. If we have 
enough computing power larger data set can be placed in the `input` folder to be processed. Output from the `bohora_maya_challenge4.py`
will be saved in to output folder when program is run.
